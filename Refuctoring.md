Refuctoring - An Overview
=========================

See [Jason Gorman's original description](http://www.waterfall2006.com/gorman.html).

"Refuctoring is the process of taking a well-designed piece of code and, through a series of small, reversible changes, making it completely unmaintainable by anybody except yourself. Comprehensive regression testing guarantees that nobody will be any the wiser."
    
### Why?

By understanding what makes code bad, we begin to understand what makes it good.

Or maybe we just learn to write bad code..

Anyway, it's good fun.

### Tips

- Save the original version of your code for comparison
- Do one refuctoring at a time
- Always check your tests still pass
- Think of a good name for your refuctoring
- Beware the power of renaming
